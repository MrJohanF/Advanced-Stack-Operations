# Advanced Stack Operations

## Overview
The Advanced Stack Operations project is a Java-based implementation that enhances the traditional stack data structure. While maintaining the standard LIFO approach with push and pop methods, this stack allows for additional operations such as search, insert, update, and delete, which can be performed at any given position in the stack.

## Features
- **Push**: Add elements to the top of the stack.
- **Pop**: Remove and return the top element of the stack.
- **Search**: Retrieve an element by its position in the stack.
- **Insert**: Add an element at a specified position.
- **Update**: Change the value of an element at a specified position.
- **Delete**: Remove an element from a specified position.

## Usage
This custom stack can be used in scenarios where a regular stack might fall short, such as when precise manipulation of the contents is required. It's especially useful in educational settings or in specific applications where data needs to be retrieved or modified anywhere within the stack, not just at the top.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, clone the repository and import it into your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse). The main class, `CustomStack`, demonstrates all the functionalities through its methods.

### Clone the Repository
